 Web Scraping Project
In this project, we attempted to scrape websites with data and answer questions regarding this data.
I decided to analyze the current, and past 5 years of results in La Liga provided by the website 'fbref.com'
I had 5 questions I set out on answering:
- How does team attendance correlate to table success? 
- Correlation between teams possesion and winning.
- What is the average age of the league this year?
- Which teams have the most goals per 90 minutes
- Who have been the most successful teams in the past 5 years? (who has the most points combined in the table over the last 5 years)

All of my work, questions, and visualizations are present in the file 'LaLigaStudy2'.
